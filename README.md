# Movement-Related-Cortical-Potential
##Official Code for STRCA, FBTRCA for Movement-Related Cortical Potential in the Brain-Computer Interface context

Steps:

1.Download data from http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets, 25. Upper limb movement decoding from EEG (001-2017); and extract files to the path "Dataset/RawData_GDF".

2.Run "gdf2mat.m" and convert GDF files to MAT files, Biosig Toolbox is necessary in this step.

3.Run "find_onset.m", "find_onset2.m", "find_onset3.m", "find_onset4.m", "find_onset5.m", which locate the movement onset and extract the EEG signals in readiness potential and movement-monitoring potential.

4.Run "analysis_0_randomindex.m" to split the dataset into the training set and testing set.

5.Run "analysis_1_filterbank.m" to divide the EEG signals into the low-frequency filter banks.

6.Run "experiment_bc_bSTRCA.m".

7.Download the codes for feature selection method from 

  (1) https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/56937-feature-selection-library
  
  (2) https://github.com/sanjitsbatra/Minimal-Complexity-Machines-Feature-Selection/tree/master/KDD%20Code
  and extract files to the dir "external".
  
8.Run "experiment_bc_bFBTRCA.m".

Notes: The second link to feature selection method contains the mRMR method and the code for quantile discretization. However, the memory increases when the mRMR method repeats in matlab code panel. When using the mRMR in this link many times, it is necessary to exit the current matlab programme and restart the panel. The alternate choice of mRMR is the first link.
